## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep teal (#008080), reminiscent of the base Firebase color.
- Background color: Very light grayish-teal (#E0EEEE).
- Accent color: Yellow-gold (#DAA520), selected to contrast with and complement the deep teal, providing an alternative to the orange/pink gradient effect of Firebase. This color also aligns to the concept of music due to gold record awards and other common signifiers.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a modern, neutral look suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use clean, minimalist icons for navigation and features; ensure they are easily recognizable and match the teal color scheme.
- Employ a card-based layout for event listings and artist profiles to keep a neat and organized display. Prioritize a mobile-first design approach.
- Use subtle animations for transitions and loading states to enhance the user experience.
